\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

\subsection{Background}
(Something more general about bridges).\\
This Master Thesis is part of a series of projects on network tied-arch bridges carried out at the institute of structural engineering at ETH Zurich. A previous Master Thesis carried out by Riccardo Cavegn investigated the optimal arch geometry and the determination of the self equilibrium stress-state. The present thesis aims to gather more insight into structural behaviour with regards to hanger density. Along with the hanger arrangement, the hanger density is the key parameter determining the fundamental behaviour of this bridge type.\\
